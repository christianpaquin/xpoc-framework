# Client-side XPOC sample pages

This is a sample implementation of client-side HTML/JavaScript pages to view and edit XPOC manifests and to validate XPOC URIs, demonstrating how to interact with XPOC artifacts. For details about XPOC, consult the [specification](../../doc/xpoc-specification.md).

The sample contains three pages (accessible from `public/index.html`):

-   `public/xpoc-editor.html`: use to create and edit XPOC manifests
-   `public/xpoc-csvconverter.html`: use to convert CSV files to XPOC manifests
-   `public/xpoc-viewer.html`: to view a XPOC manifest hosted on a website
-   `public/xpoc-validator.html`: to validate a XPOC resource associated with a XPOC URI

Note that client-side functionality could be limited by a browser security policy. For example, deploying such pages on a public facing web server would run into same-origin policy issues, preventing it from making cross-domain requests. This can be worked around by having target servers setting CORS headers, using a server-side proxy, or using a CORS proxy service. For alternative implementations, see the project's [README](../../README.md#sample-implementations).

## Self hosting

These pages can be self-hosted by following these steps:

1. Setup the express server:

```
npm install
```

2. Start the server

```
npm run start
```

The sample pages can be accessed at `http://localhost:3000/index.html`.
